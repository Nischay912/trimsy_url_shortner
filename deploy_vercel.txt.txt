Open Vercel > Login with GitHub > click on search bar > add github account > all repositories > install > select repository > keep all default options there generally there > add the environment variables there as key value pair and press deploy.

Errors came that we can't use ' apostrophe in sentences but replace all of them with &apos;

Always do : npm run build > check if build successful and then only we can again try deploy on Vercel now there.

Click on the screen that appears there after successful deployment there > get redirected to the website.

Can go on deployments > triple dot > redeploy > to deploy with changed github code there.


Now , we can go the dashboard back there of our project > and now we will change the environment variables from localhost to our vercel link we got.

So , we click on Domains > environment variables > and now we will edit the environment variables there now.

A cluster in MongoDB Atlas can hold many databases, and each database can have many collections.

Go on MongoDB atlas > which is a cloud database > go on database > create new cluster > go on shared option > select aws > asia select mumbai (should be chosen which is closest to your user) > set cluster name > go on database access > then we can create username and password there to connect with our database then there.


Then we can go back in database clusters > click on connect > add current ip address > click ok so that now : 
Only you / your backend server (the whitelisted IP) can access Atlas and All usersâ€™ data goes into the same database and collections > choose connect using  compass as we want to connect with the MongoDB compass there  > then replace <password> there with the password you created for that user in the previous step there > then we can copy that connection string and use it for connecting to the mongodb compass now there , so we can go in compass > click on + near connections there > and then we can save and connect the MongoDB atlas to MongoDB compass there ; now it will be saved as a connection there ; so in this way we can connect multiple clusters to MongoDB compass and once saved we need not remember the username password of each of those clusters there now.

Now whatever collection we'll have in the MongoDB compass can be viewed here on mongodb atlas too now > by going on data services > database > browse collections > collections > can see the document there now and can edit it there only now > and this mongodb atlas is very rare to go down , so no need to worry about that here now.

So, now instead of using MongoDB locally we now can use it on cloud now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So , now coming back to vercel > go on domains of our project > go on mongodb atlas > and get the connection string of any user you created there using the setps seen above earlier > and then paste that in the value for MONGODB_URI there in environment variables and also update the NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST to : "https://trimsy.vercel.app" and then redeploy the project > and then its done.

Note that : you can use the compass connection string in local use but when using for deployment here , click on drivers and not compass and choose latest node js version and then copy the connecction string from there.
